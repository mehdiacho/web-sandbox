# Web Sandbox

Web Sandbox is my coding playground, a single website where I embark on a journey of learning and experimentation. Here, I delve into building diverse features like a messaging platform, video player, and image-sharing space. While not aiming for complete platforms, the focus is on exploring and implementing different features using HTML, CSS, and the React framework.

## Features
- **Messaging Platform**: Explore the world of instant communication.
- **Video Player**: Dive into the creation of a customizable video playback experience.
- **Image Sharing Space**: Share, like, and comment on images in this interactive platform.
